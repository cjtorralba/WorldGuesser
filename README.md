# WorldGuess
Totally not [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com)

### Author: Christian Torralba

#### Concept:
This websites purpose...Well, this website doesn't really have a purpose. I built it for a project at school
and thought it was a pretty funny concept. I always thought GeoGuessr was a cool idea for a game, so I wanted to copy
it, but not exactly. This website is similar, but different. It provides a unique (in my opinion) approach to a guessing game by
using static satellite images of locations on earth instead of a street view map.

#### Building:
To build this project, you will need a few things. The database runs locally, using docker, and the routes are hosted on your local machine.
